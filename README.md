* First Responder of mitigating critical data loss after a version with compatibility problems was rolled back
* Performance optimizations that Reduced Server Memory Growth ~2.6x and Compute Efficiency improved by 71%

###  [+1 Speed Bridge Building](https://www.rolimons.com/game/135787657971346)

* Applied optimizations that reduced client crashes
* Fixed character instability at high speeds by creating dedicated hitboxes and tuning Humanoid State

###  [Shoot a Brainrot](https://www.rolimons.com/game/78949013360566)

* Implemented a config-driven offset system for character constructors, eliminating manual alignment errors and streamlining the workflow between the modeling and programming team.
